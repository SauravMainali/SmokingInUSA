# SmokingInUSA

Smoking cigarette kills life of 500,000 Americans every year. This is equivalent to twenty percentage of total annual death in the country. Moreover, this cause of death is preventable.  In order to prevent this distressing death rate, it is necessary to understand smoking behavior across all the states and regions.

This project uses visualization to highlight smoking trend across all states and regions of United States from the year 2013 to 2017. This could help associated agencies understand the situation so necessary steps can be taken to reduce smoking habit.
